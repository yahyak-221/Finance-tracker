I’m building a Personal Finance Tracker step-by-step using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add income and expenses, track their balance, and view insights through clean visualizations using Chart.js. All data is saved locally using localStorage, so users can access their records even after refreshing or closing the browser. It’s a simple yet powerful project to manage personal budgeting directly in the browser.
